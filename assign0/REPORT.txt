Explained how Dynammic Memory Allocation works in C (Malloc, Realloc, Calloc, Free)

2 and 3.
In the ReadLineFile it will realloc FOR EACH character that is not a newline ('\n'). 
This is inneficienct because it takes time to call the system call that realloc is 
implemented with (sbrk/brk/nmap). It might be more time efficient to double the amount 
of memory requested each time and only call when the buffer is full and needs more space.
I left the implementation how I originally designed it because I was not sure what Dr. Korkmaz wanted.
